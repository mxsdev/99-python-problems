def is_palindrome(s: str):
    """
    Write an improved palindrome method that will disregard spaces, punctuation and case and thus recognise sentences such as “A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!” as a palindrome.
    
    Example:
    ```
    print(is_palindrome("I never saw a purple cow"))
    print(is_palindrome("Rise to vote, Sir!"))

    False
    True
    ```
    """

print(is_palindrome("I never saw a purple cow"))
print(is_palindrome("Rise to vote, Sir!"))
